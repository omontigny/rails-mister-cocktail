# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# A cocktail has a name (e.g. "Mint Julep", "Whiskey Sour", "Mojito")
# An ingredient has a name (e.g. "lemon", "ice", "mint leaves")
# A dose is the amount needed for each ingredient in a cocktail (e.g. the Mojito cocktail needs 6cl of lemon). So each dose references a cocktail, an ingredient and has a description.
